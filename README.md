DAFoam: Discrete Adjoint with OpenFOAM
======================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/friedenhe/dafoam.svg?branch=v2)](https://travis-ci.com/friedenhe/dafoam.svg?branch=v2)

DAFoam contains a suite of discrete adjoint solvers for OpenFOAM. These adjoint solvers run as standalone executives to compute derivatives. DAFoam also has a Python interface that allows the adjoint solvers to interact with external modules for high-fidelity design optimization using the [MACH framework](http://mdolab.engin.umich.edu/docs/machFramework/MACH-Aero.html). DAFoam has the following features:

- It implements an efficient discrete adjoint approach with competitive speed, scalability, accuracy, and compatibility.
- It allows rapid discrete adjoint development for any steady-state OpenFOAM solvers with modifying only a few hundred lines of source codes.
- It supports design optimizations for a wide range of disciplines such as aerodynamics, heat transfer, structures, hydrodynamics, and radiation.
